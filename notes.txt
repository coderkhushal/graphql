# to fetch anything from graphql server, we use query 
# to give anything to graphql server, we use mutation
# for a query we write the logic for a query in the resolver 
# if we want to fetch the user of todo , we have to write resolver {user : async(todo) => return the user having todo.id}
# In above line , first argument is the parent , so parent's id will be taken and the user corresponding to that will be fetched
# In react , we use apollo client to use graphql
